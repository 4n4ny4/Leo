# LeoLLM
In this project, I fine-tuned the Nous Hermes Llama 2 language model using Gradient to develop Leo, a personalized AI workout coach. My focus was on fine-tuning and prompt engineering to design customized workout routines and give Leo an engaging, motivational personality. I also integrated Leo into the backend with TypeScript through calls to the Gradient API. The project includes a sample dataset in Alpaca format used for part of the fine-tuning process.
